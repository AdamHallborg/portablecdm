## How to build the Android version of the application from scratch
### Requirements
* Nodejs with npm accessible from your terminal (preferably version <= 5)
* Git installed and accessible from your terminal
* Android Studio version >= 3.0.1

Might need to add npm or git to your PATH in your operating system in order to access
them from the terminal. Both can be tested with command 'git --version' or 'npm --version'.

### Cloning the repo
1. Use the terminal to CD into your destination folder
2. Run command: git clone https://github.com/blabla/portcdm-mobile-app

### Installing EXPO
1. CD into the App folder in the repo
2. Run npm install
3. Install exponent CLI with: npm install -g exp
4. Run exp start and create an account if you don't have one already. One per application should be enough.
5. Make sure your development url is visible in terminal.

### Installing and building with Android Studio
1. Start Android Studio and select Open project.
2. Open the folder 'android' inside App in the repo.
3. Press OK or the default button all the way.
4. Follow gradle prompts and install missing SDK platforms and build tools. (there are quite a lot)
